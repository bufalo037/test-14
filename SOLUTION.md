# Project Modifications Summary

## Frontend

### `Items.js`
- Added pagination and search functionality for listing items.
- Introduced virtualization support (with buttons instead of infinite scroll).
- Enhanced CSS styling for layout and navigation consistency.

### `DataContext.js`
- Centralized data fetching using a React Context (`DataProvider`).
- Implemented `fetchItems` with `useCallback` to load items from backend (`/api/items`).
- Fixed potential memory leaks by handling component mount/unmount correctly in StrictMode.

## Backend

### `items.js`
- Implemented route `GET /api/items` to fetch items from `items.json`.
- Added support for query parameters like `limit` and search filters.
- Ensured returned items are properly parsed and validated from JSON file.

### `stats.js`
- Introduced caching mechanism to reduce unnecessary recomputation.
- Implemented a **file modification check**: stats are recalculated only if `items.json` has changed.
- Added computed stats:
  - `total` → number of items
  - `averagePrice` → mean of all item prices
- Improved error handling for file read/parse failures.

## Tests

### Items Routes Unit Tests
- Added Jest tests for `/api/items`:
  - Ensures it returns a valid list of items.
  - Verifies that query parameters like `limit` correctly restrict the result set.
  - Checks search filtering functionality.
  - Handles edge cases (empty results, invalid queries).
